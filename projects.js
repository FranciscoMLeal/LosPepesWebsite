    description: `Ciclos is a mural located at the Faro train station, a symbolic point of transition for departures and arrivals that reflects the constant movement of life.
Inspired by this transitional environment, the mural uses the circle as a central geometric form, creating a visual composition that evokes the movement of waves and the city's connection to the Atlantic Ocean and the Ria Formosa.
The painting highlights Faro's natural wealth and its connection to water, emphasising the importance of natural rhythms - tides, moon phases, and seasons - that regulate marine life and human activities such as fishing and tourism, which are essential to the local economy and to shaping the city's identity.`,

    description: `The visual narrative expressed in Power Rangers seeks to go beyond mere aesthetics, through the exploration of essential values for the development of sustainability and well-being of both people and the planet they inhabit.
The represented figures are personifications of the diversity and uniqueness that each person represents within a balanced, plural and sustainable team. Thus, each character reflects the heterogeneity of talents that constitutes the core of the success of a collective. The representation of flowers, as ephemeral and delicate elements, assumes a symbolic meaning: not only is nature essential, irreplaceable and indispensable to human life and the planet, but it also represents the importance of cultivating and caring for something to flourish - commitment, dedication, respect and gratification. This is a visual statement of the commitment to a safe workplace, where the fundamental values that shape the trajectory of all its elements meet and develop.`,

The aim was to create two courts that are not only fun to play basketball on but also has a lot of shapes and areas for kids to have fun and make up games. The courts are designed to inspire creativity and imagination in children, encouraging them to explore their surroundings and express themselves through play. The street art on the courts is bold and eye-catching, with bright colors and playful designs that capture the attention of both children and adults. The basketball court is now a place where children (of all ages) can come together, have fun, and let their imaginations run wild.`,

    year: '2024',
    description: `"From 8 to 80" is a commemorative mural celebrating traditional Portuguese toys, which hold a special place in our childhood memories. 
Our main inspiration and references come from toys produced in Valongo since 1938, with wood being their primary material. We have incorporated their original colors - yellow, pink, and blue - as well as their patterns to create an imaginary world around the Electric Transformation Station. 
Our aim is to transport viewers to a new realm of fantasy, a magical place associated with the idea of toys. The message behind the mural is that there is no age limit when it comes to playing and enjoying toys. It's a joyful experience that can be cherished from 8 to 80.`,

The painting is designed as a continuation of the stairs themselves, but regardless of where you come from, it will always feel like you are going up. The illustration features an optical illusion, so if you turn it upside down, the stairs will change as well. This way, people coming down the stairs will feel like they are going up, just like those coming from Av. Zaragoza.`,

    description: `Regardless of the season we are in, the phase of life we are in, or who we are, there are at least two absolute truths in life: the first is that water is an essential good, and the second is that dirty clothes need to be washed. And these are the truths that we illustrate in this work.
Today, we wash clothes in our homes, modernizing this hygienic habit, making it personal and of little relevance in our lives. But before, in the past, this act - now solitary - was a community gathering in washhouses*, where ideas, opinions, and visions were exchanged, making these workplaces also meeting places.
Over the years, habits have naturally changed, washhouses have lost their function to appliances and have become only buildings in the landscape, without due importance. From their golden times, memories remain of those who used them and the fantasies of those who heard of them.
In this context, all the elements we explore are related to: water - an essential element in washing clothes; the seasons of the year - because they are the great mandators of the place where the clothes would be hung (on the clothesline on the street, at home); the fantasy and memory of what washhouses once were - for the colors that make us dream and imagine the life that space once had and that we hope will return.

    description: `The acts that we narrate, are those of bravery and courage, as the story that follows, although longing for the past, is thirsty for the future.
We are the characters of this History; those who never gave up, the dreamers, the insistent and persistent, those who “see the glass half full”, “roll up their sleeves” and the ones who “lend a helping hand”.
This mural is about a pandemic that contaminated the air we breathe, challenged our freedom, separated us from our loved ones and closed thousands of doors around the world. It’s a tribute to everyone, the ones who fought, reacted, reinvented, innovated, supported, collaborated, believed and resisted together; finally, managing to tell the - so desired - History of Resilience.
Thanks to all, from Resilience we made History, these are the words you can read at the bottom of our mural: “E da Resistência se fez História”`,

    description: `At the peak of Lisbon, on the highest balcony in the entire metropolis, one can appreciate the urban landscape that stretches from the hills to the river. The blue of the water reflects the city's coastline, dotted with monuments that tell the story of Portugal, and small buildings in sandy tones. The day unfolds, and the colors of Lisbon vary. If the city wakes up pink, it lays down blue. The morning reveals the splendor of Lisbon, and the blue gives way to the mystery of poets and fado singers.
Each gaze tells its own story of the city; it is best for each person to see with their own eyes`,
