    description: `Ciclos is a mural located at the Faro train station, a symbolic point of transition for departures and arrivals that reflects the constant movement of life.
Inspired by this transitional environment, the mural uses the circle as a central geometric form, creating a visual composition that evokes the movement of waves and the city's connection to the Atlantic Ocean and the Ria Formosa.
The painting highlights Faro's natural wealth and its connection to water, emphasising the importance of natural rhythms - tides, moon phases, and seasons - that regulate marine life and human activities such as fishing and tourism, which are essential to the local economy and to shaping the city's identity.`,

    description: `Kohtakt is a mural about emotional support, connectivity, and empowerment through Psychological First Aid. The name, rooted in Ukrainian and resonating with the Portuguese “contacto,” reflects the significance of both cultures in this project. It serves as a reminder that, regardless of linguistic or cultural differences, there is always a unifying element that enables relationships and meaningful communication.
    Divided into two central elements, geometric forms and illustrated scenes, Kohtakt seeks to represent the principle of Connecting in Psychological First Aid: an immediate and temporary response focused on relieving suffering, providing emotional support, and empowering individuals in crisis by connecting them to resources, loved ones, and immediate help. Remember, it is okay to seek help, it is okay to need support, and it is okay to not be okay. Embrace connectionity and local identity.

    description: `The visual narrative expressed in <b>Power Rangers</b> seeks to go beyond mere aesthetics, through the exploration of essential values for the development of sustainability and well-being of both people and the planet they inhabit.
The represented figures are personifications of the diversity and uniqueness that each person represents within a balanced, plural and sustainable team. Thus, each character reflects the heterogeneity of talents that constitutes the core of the success of a collective. The representation of flowers, as ephemeral and delicate elements, assumes a symbolic meaning: not only is nature essential, irreplaceable and indispensable to human life and the planet, but it also represents the importance of cultivating and caring for something to flourish - commitment, dedication, respect and gratification. This is a visual statement of the commitment to a safe workplace, where the fundamental values that shape the trajectory of all its elements meet and develop.`,

The aim was to create two courts that are not only fun to play basketball on but also has a lot of shapes and areas for kids to have fun and make up games. The courts are designed to inspire creativity and imagination in children, encouraging them to explore their surroundings and express themselves through play. The street art on the courts is bold and eye-catching, with bright colors and playful designs that capture the attention of both children and adults. The basketball court is now a place where children (of all ages) can come together, have fun, and let their imaginations run wild.`,

    description: `"From 8 to 80" is a commemorative mural celebrating traditional Portuguese toys, which hold a special place in our childhood memories. 
Our main inspiration and references come from toys produced in Valongo since 1938, with wood being their primary material. We have incorporated their original colors - yellow, pink, and blue - as well as their patterns to create an imaginary world around the Electric Transformation Station. 
Our aim is to transport viewers to a new realm of fantasy, a magical place associated with the idea of toys. The message behind the mural is that there is no age limit when it comes to playing and enjoying toys. It's a joyful experience that can be cherished from 8 to 80.`,

    year: '2025',
    description: `Ovar Terra e Mar is a tile panel that celebrates the fishing tradition that shaped Ovar and captivated Portugal. The ovarinhas﻿, central figures in the composition, carry with them not only the fish. They are women of extraordinary strength who, in a public sphere dominated by men, managed to assert themselves and claim their place, without ever losing their essence or charm. Thus, the panel presents the female figure interspersed with the male, demonstrating her capacity for positioning and boldness. The composition also includes the figure of the fisherman and the fish vendor, pillars of this fishing activity, whose calloused hands tell stories of tides and shoals. Their presence evokes the collective work that helped sustain the community, from Arte Xávega﻿ to the trade that nourished generations. At the base of the panel, a boat invites viewers to become part of the narrative. This element, with an interactive purpose, aims to transform the painting into a portal where passersby can, even for a brief moment, embark on a symbolic journey, becoming part of the artwork through a setting composed of local elements. Finally, the vivid colors associated with the theme are meant to build a bridge between the seriousness of tradition and the celebration of Carnaval﻿, itself another cherished tradition of Ovar.`,

The illustration features an optical illusion, so if you turn it upside down, the stairs will change as well.

We truly believe in the social impact of these projects, so let’s keep them alive and running.`,

    description: `Regardless of the season we are in, the phase of life we are in, or who we are, there are at least two absolute truths in life: the first is that water is an essential good, and the second is that dirty clothes need to be washed. And these are the truths that we illustrate in this work.
Today, we wash clothes in our homes, modernizing this hygienic habit, making it personal and of little relevance in our lives. But before, in the past, this act - now solitary - was a community gathering in washhouses*, where ideas, opinions, and visions were exchanged, making these workplaces also meeting places.
Over the years, habits have naturally changed, washhouses have lost their function to appliances and have become only buildings in the landscape, without due importance. From their golden times, memories remain of those who used them and the fantasies of those who heard of them.
In this context, all the elements we explore are related to: water - an essential element in washing clothes; the seasons of the year - because they are the great mandators of the place where the clothes would be hung (on the clothesline on the street, at home); the fantasy and memory of what washhouses once were - for the colors that make us dream and imagine the life that space once had and that we hope will return.
*(among others, such as the banks of rivers or streams)`,

The time asked the time how much time it has. The time replied that time has as much time as time holds.
Time is the duration of our lives, but tomorrow does not exist without today. To have flowers tomorrow, one must plant them today. To be happy and fulfilled tomorrow, you must be the best person you can be now. Our painting tells a visual story about creating a better tomorrow that begins in the present. Because the better today is, the farther tomorrow will be.`,

We are the characters of this History; those who never gave up, the dreamers, the insistent and persistent, those who “see the glass half full”, “roll up their sleeves” and the ones who “lend a helping hand”.
This mural is about a pandemic that contaminated the air we breathe, challenged our freedom, separated us from our loved ones and closed thousands of doors around the world. It’s a tribute to everyone, the ones who fought, reacted, reinvented, innovated, supported, collaborated, believed and resisted together; finally, managing to tell the - so desired - History of Resilience.
Thanks to all, from Resilience we made History, these are the words you can read at the bottom of our mural: “E da Resistência se fez História”`,

    description: `Trama is a mural painting about burel, a traditional fabric from the Serra da Estrela, renowned for its unique characteristics, remarkable historical richness, and countless possibilities that transcend its original use, making it a symbol of innovation and sustainability. The composition is inspired by pattern books, which document weaving patterns and techniques. Aiming to share technical and historical information in a simple and engaging way, we sought to create a narrative about tradition, innovation, and the way burel remains a living part of both local and national identity. The colour palette reflects the duality of burel: natural tones such as green, blue, and brown evoke tradition and a connection to nature, while vibrant shades of orange, yellow, and pink symbolise the innovative spirit that has driven its modernisation. Floral elements in vases complete the visual narrative. The flowers represent the natural beauty of Manteigas, and their placement in vases serves as a metaphor for the preservation of natural and cultural heritage. Just as flowers are kept alive in water, burel stands as a living testament to our ability to learn from the past in order to build a sustainable future. Thus, Trama is a visual celebration of a symbol of creativity and local identity.`,

If the city wakes up pink, it lays down blue. The morning reveals the splendor of Lisbon, and the blue gives way to the mystery of poets and fado singers.
Each gaze tells its own story of the city; it is best for each person to see with their own eyes`,
