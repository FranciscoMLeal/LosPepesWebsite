<h1>Why do we love color so much?</h1>
Color has always been one of our main ways of communicating. In our work, it's just as important as shape and composition, because we believe it shapes how people experience an artwork. Sometimes that impact feels instant and instinctive, even like magic. A single hue can lift a mood, create tension, or draw attention without a single line or shape. That's the power of color: it works quietly, yet so effectively, and often in ways we don't fully understand.

While there are logical explanations behind why color affects us, the way it is experienced can vary from person to person. That unpredictability is what makes it both complex and fascinating. Exploring this balance has been a focus for us over the past few years, especially as a duo. We sometimes find that the same color expresses slightly different things for each of us, yet together, those differences create something richer. In this text, we want to look more closely at why color holds such a strong appeal and how it shapes the way we approach street art in particular.

<h1>The Power of color</h1>
Color alone can influence emotions, suggest ideas, and play with perception. It can create contrast, rhythm, depth, or tension. It can guide the eye across a piece or completely change how a space is read. Something that seems simple, a bright pink, a soft yellow, a bold green can end up transforming everything around it. We tend to believe that the more space color is given, the stronger and clearer its effect becomes. That's why large-scale projects feel so powerful: they give the public room to experience the full emotional and visual impact, to engage with culture, and to form a deeper connection to the work.

<h1>How we use color to create welcoming public spaces</h1>
In street art, at least in our work, color always takes a central role. And it's not just about making bold statements. It's about connection, about creating spaces that feel welcoming and alive. Color is our magic. It transforms, communicates, and interacts with the city and the people moving through it, adding energy and warmth to the concrete jungle. A wall that was once dull can suddenly become a place where people stop, look, smile, and remember.

Since it exists in public spaces, street art embodies equality. It reminds us that art belongs to everyone. By transforming impersonal surroundings, street artists foster connection and community. Color plays a central role in making this possible. It speaks to everyone, crossing cultural boundaries and languages, and helps the work connect with people immediately. Color is joy, color is life, color is our favorite medium.

Our wish for 2026 is simple: street art that's colorful, loud, proud, and an ally of hope and happiness in this grey world!
